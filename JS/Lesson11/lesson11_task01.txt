We have implemented a function wrap(value) that takes a value of arbitrary type and wraps it in a 
new Javascript Object setting the 'value' key on the new Object to the passed-in value.
So, for example, if we execute the following code:
var wrappedObj = wrap("MyWrappedString"); 
 // wrappedObject should be  {"value":"MyWrappedString"}
We would then expect the following statement to be true:
wrappedObj.value === "MyWrappedString"
Unfortunately, the code is not working as designed. Please fix the code so that it behaves as 
specified.

function wrap(value) {
 let a = 
  {
    value: value 
  };
  return a
}
