You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms 
that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being 
a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).


var rooms = {
 a: {name:'first', 
  description:'one', 
  completed:'full',},
  b:  {name:'second', 
  description:'two', 
  completed:'full',},
  c:{name:'last', 
  description:'tree', 
  completed:'full',},
    }
