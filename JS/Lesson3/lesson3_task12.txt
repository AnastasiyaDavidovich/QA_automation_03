I've hit a few bugs in my Java/Type/Coffee-script code recently, and I've traced 
the problem back to the global isNaN function I was using. I had expected it to 
be more discerning, but it's returning true for undefined right now.
Write a function isReallyNaN that returns true only if passed in an argument that 
evalutes to NaN, and returns false otherwise.

Any solution is acceptable!


return Number.isNaN(val);
