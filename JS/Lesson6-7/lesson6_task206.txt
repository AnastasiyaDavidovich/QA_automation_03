stations is a list/array of distances (miles) from one station to the next along the Pony Express 
route. Implement the riders method/function, to return how many riders are necessary to get the 
mail from one end to the other.
NOTE: Each rider travels as far as he can, but never more than 100 miles.

// function riders(stations) {
//  let a = 1;
//   let sum = 0;
//   for (let i =0; i <stations.length; i++){
//     if (sum+stations[i]>100){
//       a+=1;
//       sum = stations[i]
//      } else sum += stations[i]
//   }
//   return a;
// }
