Create a function that will return a string that combines all of the letters of 
the three inputed strings in groups. Taking the first letter of all of the inputs 
and grouping them next to each other. Do this for every letter, see example below!


function tripleTrouble(one, two, three){
   let a = '';
   for (let i = 0; i<one.length; i++){
     a += one[i]+two[i]+three[i]
   }
   return a
  }
