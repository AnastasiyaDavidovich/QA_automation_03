I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually 
the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.
P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.


function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
 
   let sum1 = 0;
   let sum2 = 0
   for (let i = 0; i< arr1.length; i++){
    sum1 += arr1[i]; 
  }
   for (let i = 0;i< arr2.length; i++){
    sum2 += arr2[i]; 
  }
     return sum1+sum2
 }
