In this Kata you are expected to find the coefficients of quadratic equation of the given two 
roots (x1 and x2).
Equation will be the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0
Return type is a Vector (tuple in Rust, Array in Ruby) containing coefficients of 
the equations in the order (a, b, c).
Since there are infinitely many solutions to this problem, we fix a = 1.

// function quadratic(x1, x2){
// let arr = [];
//   let a = 1;
//   let b = -x1-x2;
//   let c = x1 * x2;
//   arr.push(a,b,c);
//   return arr;
// }
