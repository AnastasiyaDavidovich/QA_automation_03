You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain 
number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he 
has to start counting them from 1.
As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an 
array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.

// function monkeyCount(n) {
// let arr = Array.from(Array(n+1).keys());
//   arr.shift();
//   return arr;
// }
