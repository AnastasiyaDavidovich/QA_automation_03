Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. 
Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.
When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), 
are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.
Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to 
handle the following mistakes:

S is misinterpreted as 5
O is misinterpreted as 0
I is misinterpreted as 1
The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.


function correct(string){
   let arr = string.split('');
 	for (let i =0; i<arr.length; i++){
     if (arr[i] == '5'){
       arr[i] = 'S';
     } else if (arr[i] == '0'){
       arr[i] = 'O';
     } else if (arr[i] == '1'){
       arr[i] = 'I';
     } 
   }
   return arr.join('')
 }
