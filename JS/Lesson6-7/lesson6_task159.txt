My granny has several cats. Most of them are wicked, some are normal and some of them are the 
likes of ^(~_~)^ aka holy cats. So my granny asked me to separate the holy cats from the rest 
of the crew. But I don't know how to do it. Can you help me separate the holy cats from the rest? 
In case there are no holy cats in the group, return an empty array.

// function holycats(input){
//   let arr =[];
//   for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++){
//     if (input[i] !='wicked' &&input[i] !='normal'){
//       arr.push(input[i]);
//     } 
//   }
//   return arr;
// }
