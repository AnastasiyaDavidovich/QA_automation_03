You're writing an excruciatingly detailed alternate history novel set in a world where Daniel 
Gabriel Fahrenheit was never born.Since Fahrenheit never lived the world kept on using the Rømer 
scale, invented by fellow Dane Ole Rømer to this very day, skipping over the Fahrenheit and 
Celsius scales entirely.Your magnum opus contains several thousand references to temperature, but 
those temperatures are all currently in degrees Celsius. You don't want to convert everything by 
hand, so you've decided to write a function, celsius_to_romer() that takes a temperature in 
degrees Celsius and returns the equivalent temperature in degrees Rømer.
For example: celsius_to_romer(24) should return 20.1.

// function celsiusToRomer(temp) {
// return temp*0.525+7.5
// }
