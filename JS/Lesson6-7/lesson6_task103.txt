 You have to create a function calcType, which receives 3 arguments: 2 numbers, and 
 the result of an unknown operation performed on them (also a number).
 Based on those 3 values you have to return a string, that describes which operation 
 was used to get the given result.
 The possible return strings are: "addition", "subtraction", "multiplication", "division".
 Example:
 calcType(1, 2, 3) -->   1 ? 2 = 3   --> "addition"
 Notes
 In case of division you should expect that the result of the operation is obtained 
 by using / operator on the input values - no manual data type conversion or rounding 
 should be performed.
 Cases with just one possible answers are generated.
 Only valid arguments will be passed to the function.

 function calcType(a, b, res) {
   if (a+b==res) {
     return "addition";
   } else if (a-b == res){
     return "subtraction";
   } else if (a*b == res){
     return "multiplication";
   } else if (a/b== res) {
     return "division"
   }
 }
