Two tortoises named A and B must run a race. A starts with an average speed of 
720 feet per hour. Young B knows she runs faster than A, and furthermore has 
not finished her cabbage.

When she starts, at last, she can see that A has a 70 feet lead but B's speed 
is 850 feet per hour. How long will it take B to catch A?

More generally: given two speeds v1 (A's speed, integer > 0) and v2 (B's speed, 
integer > 0) and a lead g (integer > 0) how long will it take B to catch A?

The result will be an array [hour, min, sec] which is the time needed in hours, 
minutes and seconds (round down to the nearest second) or a string in some 
languages.

If v1 >= v2 then return nil, nothing, null, None or {-1, -1, -1} for C++, 
C, Go, Nim, Pascal, [-1, -1, -1] for Perl,[] for Kotlin or "-1 -1 -1".

Examples:
(form of the result depends on the language)

race(720, 850, 70) => [0, 32, 18] or "0 32 18"
race(80, 91, 37)   => [3, 21, 49] or "3 21 49"


function race(v1, v2, g) {
    if (v2>=v1){
     let a = g/(v2-v1)*3600;
     let arr = [];
     arr[0] = Math.floor(a/3600);
     arr[1] = Math.floor((a-arr[0]*3600)/60);
     arr[2] = Math.floor(a -arr[0]*3600- arr[1]*60);
   return arr;
 }else {
   return null;
 }
   }
