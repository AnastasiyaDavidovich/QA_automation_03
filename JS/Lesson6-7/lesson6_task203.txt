This challenge extends the previous repeater() challenge. Just like last time, your job is to 
write a function that accepts a string and a number as arguments. 
This time, however, you should format the string you return like this:
>>> repeater('yo', 3)'"yo" repeated 3 times is: "yoyoyo"'
>>> repeater('WuB', 6)'"WuB" repeated 6 times is: "WuBWuBWuBWuBWuBWuB"'

// function repeater(string, n) {
//   return `"${string}" repeated ${n} times is: "${string.repeat(n)}"`
// }
