 Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know 
 once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and 
 the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.
 Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true 
 if they are in love and false if they aren't.

 function lovefunc(flower1, flower2){
   return ((flower1%2 ==0 && flower2%2!=0) || (flower1%2 !=0 && flower2%2==0))
 }
