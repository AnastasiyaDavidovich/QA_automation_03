 Complete the solution so that it reverses all of the words within the string passed in.
 Example:
 "The greatest victory is that which requires no battle" --> "battle no requires which 
 that is victory greatest The"

 function reverseWords(str){
   str = str.split(' ')
   let arr = [];
   for (let i = str.length-1; i>=0; i--){
     arr.push(str[i]);
   }
   return arr.join(' ')
 }
