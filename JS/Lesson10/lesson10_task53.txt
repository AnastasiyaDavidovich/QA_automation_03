 In this exercise, a string is passed to a method and a new string has to be returned 
 with the first character of each word in the string.
 For example:
 "This Is A Test" ==> "TIAT"
 Strings will only contain letters and spaces, with exactly 1 space between words, 
 and no leading/trailing spaces.

 function makeString(s){
   let arr = s.split(' ');
   for (let i = 0; i<arr.length; i++){
     arr[i]=arr[i].slice(0,1)
   }
   return arr.join('')
 }
