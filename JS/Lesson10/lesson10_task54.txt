 Take a sentence (string) and reverse each word in the sentence. Do not reverse the 
 order of the words, just the letters in each word.
 If there is punctuation, it should be interpreted as a regular character; no special rules.
 If there is spacing before/after the input string, leave them there.
 String will not be empty.
 Examples
 "Hi mom" => "iH mom"
 " A fun little challenge! " => " A nuf elttil !egnellahc "

 function reverser(sentence) {
 	let arr = sentence.split(' ');
   arr = arr.map(el=>{
     let el1= '';
     for (let i = el.length-1; i>=0; i--){
       el1 +=el[i];
     }
     return el1;
   })
   return arr.join(' ');
 }
