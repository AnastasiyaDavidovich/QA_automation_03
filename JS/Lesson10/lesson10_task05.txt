 I'm creating a scoreboard on my game website, but I want the score to be displayed 
 as tally marks instead of Roman numerals. Write a function that translates the numeric 
 score into tally marks.
 My tally mark font uses the letters a, b, c, d, e to represent tally marks for 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively. I want a space and line break ( ) after each completed 
 tally (5).
 Assume that the score you receive will be an integer. This function should return 
 an HTML string that I can insert into my website that represents the correct score.

 var scoreToTally = function(score){
   let x = score%5;
   let y = Math.floor(score/5);
   let z
   switch (x){
     case 1:
       z = 'a';
       break;
     case 2:
       z = 'b';
       break;
     case 3:
       z = 'c';
       break;
     case 4:
       z = 'd';
       break;
     case 0:
       z = 'e';
       break;
     }
  
   let sum = 'e <br>'.repeat(y);
   if (x == 0) return `${sum}`
   else return `${sum}${z}`    
 }
