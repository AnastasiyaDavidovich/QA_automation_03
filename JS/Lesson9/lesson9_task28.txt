 Oh no! Timmy hasn't followed instructions very carefully and forgot how to use 
 the new String Template feature, Help Timmy with his string template so it 
 works as he expects!
  function buildString(...template){
    return `I like #{template.join(',')}`;
  }

 function buildString(...template){
   return `I like ${template.join(', ')}!`;
 }
