 In this kata the function returns an array/list of numbers without its last 
 element. The function is already written for you and the basic tests pass, 
 but random tests fail. Your task is to figure out why and fix it.
 Hint: watch out for side effects.

 function withoutLast(arr) {
   let arr2= arr.slice()
   arr2.pop()
   return arr2
 }
