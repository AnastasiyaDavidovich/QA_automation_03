Write a code that  calculates Volume of the cube with length of side = 7  and 
calculate length of all sides. Return statement “The volume of the cube = 
...    with length of 1 side = … and length of all sides …” -> using ` ${}`.

 let s = 7;
 let v = s ** 3;
 let p = s * 12;
 console.log(`The volume of the cube = ${v} with length of 1 side = ${s} and length of all sides ${p}`);
