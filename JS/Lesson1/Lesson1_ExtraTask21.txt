Three boys have three boxes. Each boy has 120lbs of weight. Each box has 2 
lbs of apples inside. One boy ate half of the box of apples in his box.  
Question: What is the total lbs boys and apples together? 
Create the variables and count the amount.

 let w1 = 120;
 let w2 = 2;
 w1 = w1 * 3 + w2 / 2;
 w2 = w2 * 3 - w2 / 2;

 let wt = w1 + w2;
 console.log(w1, w2, wt);
