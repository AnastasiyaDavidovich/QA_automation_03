Create a variable with a name “word”, assign it with value “VOLUME”. 
By using modulus find the remainder  of  2 divisions between 90 and 8; 11 and 2. 
Print string that consists of an index of variable “word” equals first division, 
then second division, next - first char of the string and the last index. 
Divide indexes with new lines (\n). 

 let world = 'VOLUME';
 let a = 90 % 8;
 let b = 11 % 2;
 let lA = world[a];
 let lB = world[b];
 console.log(lA);
 console.log(lB);
 console.log(`${lA}\n ${lB}\n ${world[0]}\n ${world[world.length - 1]}`);
