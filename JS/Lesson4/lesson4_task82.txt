Debug celsius converter
Your friend is traveling abroad to the United States so he wrote a program to convert fahrenheit 
to celsius. Unfortunately his code has some bugs.
Find the errors in the code to get the celsius converter working properly.
To convert fahrenheit to celsius:
celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9)
Remember that typically temperatures in the current weather conditions are given in whole numbers. 
It is possible for temperature sensors to report temperatures with a higher accuracy such as to 
the nearest tenth. Instrument error though makes this sort of accuracy unreliable for many types 
of temperature measuring sensors.


 function weatherInfo (temp) {
  let temp1 = (temp - 32) * (5/9)
   if (temp1 < 0){
     return (temp1 + " is freezing temperature")
  } else {
     return (temp1 + " is above freezing temperature")
 }
   }
