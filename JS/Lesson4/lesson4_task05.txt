Create a function that takes in the sum and age difference of two people, calculates their 
individual ages, and returns a pair of values (oldest age first) if those exist or null/None 
if: sum < 0, difference < 0
Either of the calculated ages come out to be negative

 hint: in the end use => return [age2, age1]
 
function getAges(sum,difference){
   let age1 = (sum + difference) / 2;
   let age2 = sum - age1;
   let arr
   if (sum < 0 || difference < 0) {
     return (null)
   } else if (age1 < 0 || age2 < 0) {
     return (null)
   } else if (age1 > age2) { 
     return arr = [age1, age2]
   }
  }
