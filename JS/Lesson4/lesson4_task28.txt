Your job is simple, if (x) squared is more than 1000, return 'It's hotter than the sun!!', else, 
return 'Help yourself to a honeycomb Yorkie for the glovebox.'.
X will be a valid integer number.
X will be either a number or a string. Both are valid.

function apple(x){
return (x**2 > 1000 ? "It's hotter than the sun!!":"Help yourself to a honeycomb Yorkie for the glovebox.")
 }
