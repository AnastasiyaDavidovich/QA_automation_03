I have a cat and a dog which I got as kitten / puppy.
I forget when that was, but I do know their current ages as catYears and dogYears.
Find how long I have owned each of my pets and return as a list [ownedCat, ownedDog]
NOTES:
Results are truncated whole numbers of "human" years
Cat Years
15 cat years for first year
+9 cat years for second year
+4 cat years for each year after that
Dog Years
15 dog years for first year
+9 dog years for second year
+5 dog years for each year after that


 var ownedCatAndDog = function(catYears, dogYears) {
  let dog, cat;
   let arr = [];  
  
   if (catYears > 0 && catYears < 15){
     cat = 0
   } else if (catYears >= 15 && catYears < 24){
     cat = 1;
   } 
   else if (catYears >= 24 && catYears < 28){
     cat = 2;
   }
     else {
     cat = Math.floor((catYears - 24) / 4 + 2)
   }
     
   if (dogYears > 0 && dogYears < 15) {
     dog = 0;
   } else if (dogYears >= 15 && dogYears < 24){
     dog = 1;
   } else if (dogYears >= 24 && dogYears < 29){
     dog = 2
   }
     else {
     dog = Math.floor((dogYears - 24) / 5 + 2)
   }   
   return [cat, dog];
 }
