Complete the function to give the 3 strings str1, str2, str3 the correct values to ensure that 
each student recieves the right message. 70 is the pass mark, so create a function that uses this 
grade boundary and returns either:
"Sorry, you have failed. Better luck next time!"
or
"Congratulations, you have passed!"
Whether they pass or fail, both strings end with this string:
"Thank you for taking part."
Things to note:
The grade boundary is 70 and is inclusive with the score of 70 considered a pass.
You can use the String .concat() method or any other method you see fit to bring the strings 
together.
Scores cannot be lower than 0 and will always be given as a number


 function getRes(myScore) {
 let a = "Thank you for taking part."
 let b = "Congratulations, you have passed!"
 let c = "Sorry, you have failed. Better luck next time!"
 return myScore >= 70 ? `${b} ${a}` : `${c} ${a}`
 }
