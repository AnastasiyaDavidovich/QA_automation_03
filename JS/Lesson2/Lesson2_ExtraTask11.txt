Declare variables named: apple, banana and kiwi with prices 5, 10 and 7. Declare 
var sum which is the amount for three fruits one of each type. Declare new 
variable result - which is equal to your actual amount spent, then check:

If result less than sum - “You forget to buy smth, check once again”;

If result is greater than sum - “You going to pay more for ( subtraction sum from 
result) dollars, check again“;

If the result is equal to the sum- “Your shopping is done.”
 

let apple = 5;
 let banana = 10;
 let kiwi = 7;
 let sum = apple + banana + kiwi;
 let res = 22;
 if (res < sum) { 
     console.log('You forget to buy smth, check once again')}
   else if (res > sum) {
     console.log(`You going to pay more for ${res - sum} dollars, check again`)}
    else if (res == sum) { 
       console.log ('Your shopping is done.')};
