Create variables for the names with age: Tom, Sam, Jack, Ted. Tom is 16, each 
friend is 2 years older, starting from Tom in order. 
  a)Count the age of each person;
  b) Insert the names with the age to the string, using concatenation and ${}: 
“Tom is - 16 years old, Sam is - …. years old, Jack is … years old, Ted is … 
years old. And the total of our age is ….years old”. 
  c) Find out what is the Unicode Value of the 1sr letter of the name, and add 
the total to the string: “The total of the Unicode values of the 1st letter of 
the all names is ….!”.

 let tom = 16;
 let sam = tom + 2;
 let jack = sam + 2;
 let ted = jack + 2;
 let tot = tom + sam + jack + ted;
 console.log(`Tom is ${tom} years old, Sam is ${sam} years old, Jack is ${jack} years old, Ted is ${ted} years old. And the total of our age is ${tot} years old`);

 let str = `Tom is ${tom} years old, Sam is ${sam} years old, Jack is ${jack} years old, Ted is ${ted} years old. And the total of our age is ${tot} years old`
 let ind1 = str.charCodeAt(0);
 let ind2 = str.charCodeAt(20);
 let ind3 = str.charCodeAt(41);
 let ind4 = str.charCodeAt(62);
 let indT = ind1 + ind2 + ind3 + ind4;
 console.log(`The total of the Unicode values of the 1st letter of the all names is ${indT}!`);
