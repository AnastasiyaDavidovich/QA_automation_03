You were paid 5000 in January, and in February you were paid 20% more. 
Count your total payment, print in console the type of the total payment, 
and print in console concatenation of string "I have " and the total 
payment. 
You want to buy a new car. Create a variable with the car cost 
20000. Then create a string with the name “question” and value 
"Can I buy Nissan for ". Create a variable of Boolean data type with 
value where you compare your total pay and the car cost. Print in console 
the sentence using concatenation of your variables  in order to have 
output in console you will see “Can I buy Nissan for my payment for 
two months ?”). The last step – print in console your comparison variable.


 let j = 5000;
 let f = j * 1.2;
 let t = j + f;
 console.log(typeof (t));
 console.log(`I have ${t}`);

 let cC = 20000;
 let question = "Can I buy Nissan for ";
 let ans = (t > cC);
 console.log(`Can I buy Nissan for my payment for two months ? ${ans}`);
 console.log(ans);
