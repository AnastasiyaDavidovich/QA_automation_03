  3. Friday - 6pm;
  4. Sunday - 1pm;
   
  Case 1: Bob can fly Monday any time, and Tuesday after 3pm. And Friday till 
5pm, and Sunday till 12.30pm.   Bill can fly Monday after 4pm, and Tuesday anytime.

 Case 2: Bob can fly only Friday after 3pm, and Sunday any time; Bill can fly 
Monday after 10:01am, or Tuesday after 11:55pm. Or Friday till afternoon, and
