Solve a task with logical operators in such a way as on example:

Example:
 let chocolate = true;
 let strawberry = false;
 let apple = true;
 let caramel = true;

 case 1: I want ((strawberry and chocolate) or apple) or no caramel
 let icecream = ((strawberry && chocolate) || apple) || !caramel;
 console.log("case 1: " + icecream);

 case 2: I want (strawberry and (chocolate or apple)) or without caramel
 icecream = (strawberry && (chocolate || apple)) || !caramel;
 console.log("case 2: " + icecream);

TASKS:
case 1: (Number a is bigger than number b) and b is not equal to 0 or a 
is not negative number; => the result is true
case 2: (Number a is a positive number or number b is a positive number) 
or b is not equal to 0 and a is equal to 7; => the result is true

 let a = 5;
 let b = 7;

case 1:
 let case1 = (a > b) && b !== 0 || a >= 0;
 console.log('case 1: ' + case1);

case 2:
 let case2 = (a >= 0 || b >= 0) || b !== 0 && a == 7;
 console.log('case 2: ' + case2);
