We have string let str = '124, 45, 8';     
Show in Console if numbers in string are even: true/false.
Expected to see:
`Number 1: [show number] is even: true;
 number 2: [show number] is even: false;
 number 3: [show number] is  even: trueâ€™

 let str = '124, 45, 8';
 let n1 = str[0] + str[1] + str[2];
 n1 = +n1;
 let n2 = str[5] + str[6];
 n2 = +n2
 let n3 = str[str.length - 1];
 n3 = +n3;
 let e1 = n1 % 2 == 0;
 let e2 = n2 % 2 == 0;
 let e3 = n3 % 2 == 0;

 console.log(`Number 1: ${n1} is even: ${e1}`);
 console.log(`Number 2: ${n2} is even: ${e2}`);
 console.log(`Number 3: ${n3} is even: ${e3}`);
