Solve a task with logical operators in such a way as on example:

Example:
 let chocolate = true;
 let strawberry = false;
 let apple = true;
 let caramel = true;

 case 1: I want ((strawberry and chocolate) or apple) or no caramel
 let icecream = ((strawberry && chocolate) || apple) || !caramel;
 console.log("case 1: " + icecream);

 case 2: I want (strawberry and (chocolate or apple)) or without caramel
 icecream = (strawberry && (chocolate || apple)) || !caramel;
 console.log("case 2: " + icecream);

TASKS:
case 1: (The new building has 9 windows or a door) and the guest name is John or the address has a data type of a boolean 
=> the result is true
case 2: The new building has 8 windows or (no door and the guest name is John) or the address has a data type of a number 
=> the result is true

 let windows = 8;
 let door = true;
 let guest = 'John';
 let address = 5;

case 1:
 let bild1 = (windows == 9 || door == true) && guest == 'John' || typeof (adress) == 'boolen';
 console.log(bild1);

case 2:
 let bild2 = windows == 8 || (door == false && guest == 'John') || typeof (adress) == 'number'
 console.log(bild2);
