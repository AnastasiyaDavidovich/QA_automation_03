Solve a task with logical operators in such a way as on example:

Example:
 let chocolate = true;
 let strawberry = false;
 let apple = true;
 let caramel = true;

 case 1: I want ((strawberry and chocolate) or apple) or no caramel
 let icecream = ((strawberry && chocolate) || apple) || !caramel;
 console.log("case 1: " + icecream);

 case 2: I want (strawberry and (chocolate or apple)) or without caramel
 icecream = (strawberry && (chocolate || apple)) || !caramel;
 console.log("case 2: " + icecream);

TASKS:
case 1: (Data type of 'one' is a string and (data type of 'two' is a 
boolean or number)) and data type of three is not a boolean 
=> the result is false
case 2: (Data type of 'one' is a number and data type of 'two' is boolean) or
(data type of 'three' is not a boolean or data type of one is not a string) 
=> the result is true

 let one = 0;
 let two = 'Hello';
 let three = true;

case 1:
 let case1 = typeof (one) == 'string' && (typeof (two) == 'boolen' || typeof (two) == 'number') && typeof (three) != 'boolen';
 console.log(case1);

case 2:
 let case2 = (typeof (one) == 'number' && typeof (two) == 'boolen') || typeof (three) != 'boolen' || typeof (one) != 'string';
 console.log(case2);
