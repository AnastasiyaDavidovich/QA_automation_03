Compare two wishes: "I want to be a QA Engineer" and "I don't want to do my 
homework". The wish that has a higher value of the string will come true.
Will I become a QA Engineer? 

 let str1 = 'I want to be a QA Engineer';
 let str2 = "I don't want to do my homework";
 console.log(str1 > str2);
 console.log(`Will I become a QA Engineer? `);
